# Continue with ex1_multi.R

# Surface and contour graphs could use some extra work
	- other libraries for surface plots (ggplot?) 
	- play around with stat_contour parameters

# Add a graph to the main README

# Clean up comments and code

# Understand how melt works in line 146
	- it performs a sort of reverse `expand.grid`, but why?
	- what happens to `theta0_vals` and `theta1_vals`?
	- new contour plot (lines 136-141) is clear, but older (lines 144-154) seems faster..
